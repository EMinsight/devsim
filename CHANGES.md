### Version 1.4.7

In the simple physics models, the sign for time-derivative terms was wrong for the electron and hole continuity equations.  This affects small-signal and noise simulations.  The example at ``examples/diode/ssac_diode.py`` was updated to reflect the error.

### Version 1.4.6

#### Version Information

Parameter ``info`` can be queried for getting version information.  The file ``testing/info.py`` contains an example.

```
  python info.py
  {'copyright': 'Copyright Â© 2009-2020 DEVSIM LLC', 'direct_solver': 'mkl_pardiso', 'extended_precision': True, 'license': 'Apache License, Version 2.0', 'version': '1.4.6', 'website': 'https://devsim.org'}
```

#### Extended Precision

The example ``examples/diode/gmsh_diode3d_float128.py`` provides an example where extended precision is enabled.

#### Python Formatting

The Python scripts in the ``examples`` and ``testing`` directories have been reformatted to be more consistent with language standards.

#### Platforms

Microsoft Windows 10 is supported and is now compiled using Microsoft Visual Studio 2019.

Microsoft Windows 7 is no longer supported, as Microsoft has dropped support as of January 14, 2020.

#### External Meshing

Support for reading meshes from Genius Device Simulator has been completely removed from DEVSIM.


### Version 1.4.5

* Platform Support:
  * An MSYS2/Mingw-w64 build is available for 64-bit Windows.  This build, labeled ``devsim_msys_v1.4.5``, enables the use of the 128-bit floating point precision already available on the macOS and Linux platforms.

### Version 1.4.4

* Bug Fixes:
  * Intermittent crash on Windows 10 at the end of the program
* CHANGES.md containing version changes in markdown format.
* Internal changes:
  * Regression system script refactored to Python.
  * Refactor threading code using C++11 functions
  * Refactor timing functions for verbose mode using C++11 functions.
  * Refactor FPE detection code to C++11 standard.
